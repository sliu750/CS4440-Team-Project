# Analysis and Visualization of Workplace Injuries

This project analyzes and visualizes workplace injury trends over the years to provide insights into job and industry-related risks. Our goal is to support professionals in the safety industry, such as health and safety administrators and safety equipment manufacturers, as well as everyday people considering career choices.

**Data Sourcing and Preprocessing**:

  - Collected data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (https://www.bls.gov/iif/fatal-injuries-tables/archive.htm#RATES)
  - Cleaned and organized the data using SQL to make it easier to analyze    

**Machine Learning and Statistical Models**:

  - Used Python's sklearn library to predict future injury rates by demographic, industry, and occupation

**Visualization and Dashboard**:

  - Utilized Tableau to showcase and compare injury rates by year and by demographic, industry, and occupation
  - Publisehed results to a front-end dashboard webpage
  - Note: To see our dashboard, please go to Webpage folder, and open page.html

**Key Findings**:

  - Not surprisingly, the agriculture, mining, warehousing, and construction industries by far have the highest injury rates.
  - These insights can inform safety protocols and influence occupational health policies.
