# CS4440-Team-Project

The goal of this project is to analyze and visualize workplace injury trends over the years, aiming to provide insights into job and industry-related risks. This would support professionals in the safety industry, such as health and safety administrators and safety equipment manufacturers. The information would also benefit everyday people considering which occupation to go into.

We sourced datasets on workplace injuries from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (https://www.bls.gov/iif/fatal-injuries-tables/archive.htm#RATES) and processed them using SQL to clean and organize the data. Then, we implemented machine learning and statistical models using Python's sklearn library to predict future injury rates by demographic, industry, and occupation. 

Finally, we created interactive displays with Tableau to showcase and compare injury rates by year and for each category of interest (i.e. demographic, industry, occupation), and published the results to a front-end dashboard webpage. Not surprisingly, the agriculture, mining, warehousing, and construction industries by far have the highest injury rates.
