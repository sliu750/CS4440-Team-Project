# CS4440-Team-Project

Group project for CS 4440: Emerging Database Technologies

The goal of this project is to analyze and visualize workplace injury trends over the years- such information would help people understand the risks of certain jobs and industries, and provide insight to those who work in the safety industry (e.g. health and safety administrators, safety equipment manufacturers).

We used SQL to process and clean datasets about workplace injuries from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (https://www.bls.gov/iif/fatal-injuries-tables/archive.htm#RATES). Then, we implemented machine learning and statistical models using Python's sklearn library to predict future injury rates by demographic, industry, and occupation. Finally, we created interactive displays with Tableau to showcase injury rates by year and for each category of interest (i.e. demographic, industry, occupation), and published the results to a front-end dashboard webpage.
